# Code Quiz

For this project I have created a timed Code Quiz with five multiple choice questions. Once the questions have been completed, the user can enter their initials and their score will save to the highscores board.

# Technologies used

For this project I have used HTML, CSS and Javascript and have built this project from scratch with no starter code.
